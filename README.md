=# LLM-Powered Agent

## Project Overview

This project develops an LLM (Large Language Model) powered agent designed to answer natural language questions. Utilizing advanced language processing technologies, the agent demonstrates basic conversational capabilities through a web interface. The primary focus is on configurability, scalability, design and accuracy of responses.

### Key Features

- Natural language question answering
- Web interface for enhanced user interaction
- Configurable and scalable design suitable for future enhancements
